# Choosing the right text editor 
When choosing a text editor it is important to note that the *best text editor* might not always be the right one for you.

Choosing a text editor is like choosing what type of phone you want. For some of us it could be an iphone, android, or maybe even a blackberry. From a software standpoint it could be a notepad, Visual studio code, atom, etc. Whichever one you choose it is important to understand what comes with the options and how able you are in using the tools or feautures that come with it. I think the best way to truly find the best fit for you is to test out a couple of the different options and see which one best suits you.
