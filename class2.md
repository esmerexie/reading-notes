When choosing a text editor it is important to note that the [best text editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) might not always be the right one for you.

Choosing a text editor is like choosing what type of phone you want. For some of us it could be an iphone, android, or maybe even a blackberry. From a software standpoint it could be a notepad, Visual studio code, atom, etc. Whichever one you choose, it is important to understand what comes with the options and how able you are in using the tools or feautures that come with it. For example, when using the default notepad that came pre-installed in your computer you won't be able to have highlighted syntax when compared to a text editor such as Visual code studio. Another example would be changing the theme of the application to reduce eye strain when looking at the computer screen for long periods of time. These benefits or features are not accessible to a regular notepad as compared to a third party text editor. I think the best way to truly find the best fit for you is to test out a couple of the different options and see which one best suits you.
