simply put is a way to is when you write a code that will invoke itself and makes the code easier to read and understand.

## [Data Structures in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM)

### 5 most important Data Structures to know or understand

> Linked List - a node that contains a value and a pointer.

Good at adding and deleting items.

Not good at retrieving or searching information.

> Array - a structure of fixed size which can hold the same data type.

Good at retriving items but not really great at adding items.

> Hash-table - Stores data in an associative manner using a key and a value and memory locations do not need to be next to eachother.

Good at adding, removing, and retrieving. But the major downfall is key collisions.

> Stack and Queue - stack is last one in, last one out. Queue is first one in, first one out.

Effiecient at adding and removing but has very limited use.

> Graphs and Trees - Graphs are similar to a linked list / Trees are types of graphs.

Good at searching for items but can become unbalanced.

## [BigO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)

The 4 important steps in the BigO

1. Different steps get added

2. Drop constants

3. Different inputs => different variables

4. Drop non-dominant terms

## Discussion Questions

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- How effiecient and how well it solves the problem.

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- Be sure to let the function know when to stop.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about data structures and when we will be using them.
