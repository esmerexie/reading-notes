# Prep: Introduction to SQL

After finishing all the required exercises I now have a little understanding on how SQL works. SQL is a database that can store information in a table like format.

I learned that we can use methods such as

```Sql
DELETE FROM which deletes items inside the table
INSERT INTO which adds a new item 
UPDATE which can update an existing item
CREATE TABLE which can create a new table 
ALTER TABLE which can add new columns and values into the table
DROP TABLE which deletes the entire table
```

Below are the last 2 lessons of the SQL prework lesson 6 and lesson 18.
