# Readings

Today I learned the [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/index.html) Basics. It went over Variables and how we have to declare the type beforehand

```Java
int example = 22;
```

And to make sure to add the semicolun after every ending of a code sentence. I learned that Naming a variable is case sensitive and using and underscore as the begginning of a variable should not be praticed.

I learned a little bit about operators and their use. However I still do want to see some of them in action such as

```Java

<< >> shift
< >, <= >= instanceof
expr++, expr -- postifx

```

I also learned about Expressions, Statements, and Blocks. I read how an expression is made up of variables, operators, and method invocations.

```Java

int result = 1 + 2; // result is now 3
if (value1 == value2) 
    System.out.println("value1 == value2");

```

And learned that the order in which an expression is evaulated does not matter unless you specify otherwise.

```Java

1 + 2 * 3 //unimportant 

1 + (2 * 3) // specified importance

```

Today I also read on Control Flow Statements and how generally are executed from top to bottom.
