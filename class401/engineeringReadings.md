# Engineering Readings

## [Act like you make $1000/hr](https://anthony-moore.medium.com/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-6ab2302b8e8c)

From what I have read understanding that time is very vauluable and not many people understand how valuable it is. Would you give your time for free to something that is unproductive or would you give your time to something that'll produce results in the way that you want for the future. It is okay to not be busy and it is not okay to be busy doing things that are unproductive.

## [How to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)

What I took from this is to understand how important it is to understand how to solve a problem. Anyone can learn to code but not everyone can understand how to solve a problem.

### steps to do when you encounter a new problem

1. Understand - know what exactly is being asked.

2. Plan - plan out your solution instead of immediatley trying to code out the problem.

3. Divide - understand to try and not solve the problem in its entirety but break it down into sub probelms and work your way through.

4. Stuck - know that it is okay to step away and take a break.

I can say confidently that this has changed my view on learning. Instead of focusing on the failures everytime I fail to make something when writing in code, take it as a learning experience and to see where I failed and what didn't work and try again. I should never see a problem and think to myself that I can't solve it rather to look at it in another persepective see it as a goal to solve it. This video gave me a whole new insight and I can't wait to put it into action.

## Discussion Questions

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I am confident in my ability to adapt to situations. One thing my job as a Hydraulic tech has teached me is the ability to understand what is going on and what went wrong. Like coding you can't solve a problem if you don't know how it works. Although I am still improving my technical skill when it comes to coding, I am confident that if I continue to keep learning and understaning how to problem solve, I can be not only a better assest/coder to a company but also a teacher being able to help others who are stuck in situations that they can't seem to solve.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. read the problem

2. understand the problem.

3. layout what the problem entails and work from there.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about problem solving and how others solve their problems when it comes to difficult ones that is not easy to solve.
