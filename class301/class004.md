# Readings: React and Forms

The answers given are reffered from [Here](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

## React Docs - Forms

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- An input form element whose value is controlled by React.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- We should update the form as soon as they enter them so that the value of thier input can be shown.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- The value attribute

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

Why would we use a ternary operator?

- to shorten our line of code

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```js

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}


x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
```
