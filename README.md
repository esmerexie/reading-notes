# Welcome to my Reading Journal.

Hello my name is [Rexie Esmeralda](https://github.com/esmerexie) and these are my notes on my journey to becoming a software developer!

### Growth Mindset

*What does [growth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) mean to me?*

```
- able to develop and grow overtime
- doesn't steer away from a challenge 
- accepts failure and strives to be better
- takes criticism well and grows from it
- doesn't limit their potential due to the success of others 
- takes time to learn even on their off time

```
