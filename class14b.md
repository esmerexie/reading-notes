## Things I want to know more about

Is how to work better with teams. I want to know more about effectivly working well with others. In the article on how google built the perfect team, I read that people were more effective when people in the team were more comfortable with eachother rather than a strict workplace. I think that is true to the sense where I think most people wouldn't feel comfortable working in a really strict enviornment.
