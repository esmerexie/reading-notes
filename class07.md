# Readings

## Domain Modeling

What is [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)? It is the proccess of creating a concept of a model in code for a specific problem.

> Explain why we need domain modeling

Domain modeling is used so we can help validate our ideas.

## HTML Tables Basic

> Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

- it reduces the readability for visually impaired users.

- It produces much more complex code that is harder to read, understand, debug, and write.

- Tables are not automatically responsive.

> List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table.

```css

<td></td>  // stands for table data
<tr></tr>  // stands for table row 
<th></th>  // adds a header 

```

## Introducing Constructors

> What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

The advantage comes when you need to create an object but are able to reuse the same object for multiple variations.

> How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

this when used in an object literal verus when used in a constructor is that in a object literal it refers to the code that is being written inside and can only be used once. When used in a constructor you can reuse it for many different purposes.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

> Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

I need to return to this question

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more on how to use constructors. I found that after reading these required readings that there was a lot in here that I could've used for yesterdays lab and would of made my life a whole lot easier seeing and understanding a way to write what I am trying to picture into code.
