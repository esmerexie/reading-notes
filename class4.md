## What is Wireframe?  

When thnking about [Wireframe](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/), think about writing an essay. When writing an essay you have to think about the topic at hand, how you are going to write it out, the research, and when all that is said and done you are going to have to type it all out. Wireframe is quite similar, you have to think of a design, draw out the design, finalize the design, then start coding. 

> a tip before starting to wireframe is to write down all your ideas so you can have a better idea on how you're going to lay it all out.

When it comes to wireframing, sure you can write it down and draw it all on a paper but there are third party tools that can make collaborating and planning easier.

## Three key principles

When starting to wireframe there are some key principles to keep in mind.

- Clarity - The wireframe needs to be what the site is and what it shouldn't be. It needs to satisfy the user and their needs.  

- Confidence - There is no reason to over complicate a design and make things non-user friendly.  

- Simplicity is key - there is not much to be said about this one but keep things simple.
