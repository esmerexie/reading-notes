# Hello
This is just an extra page on where I talk about my experience so far and my understanding of what I've learned. I will try my best to update this page as often as I can throughout this course.

## Logs
**Day 1** - no logs.

**Day 2** - I learned about HTML and Wireframing. Although there was much to learn today, it wasn't as hectic as day 1. Unfortunately I did not have the idea to start this page as it only occured to me as it was a part of today's assignment that I an extra page. I really enjoy my experience and the enviornment codefellows brings. It can get quite challenging but I love it.
