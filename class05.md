> Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

I would first add some color this his website by making his background color more of a stone grey. And adding some borders to his text. By using this css code in a style sheet

```css

body {
    background-color: ;
}

h1 {
    border-style: ;
    height: ;
    width: ;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    background-color: ;
    padding: ;

```

The one important thing when considering what fonts to use in an HTML document is the Web Safe Fonts. There are some fonts that aren't availble on some OS and an example of a font is Trebuchet MS.

> What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

Font-size does what the name entails. It changes the font size. Font weight in the other hand sets how bold the text is. Font style changes the style of a default text to something like italic or bold.

```css

h1 {
  
  letter-spacing: 1px;
}

h1 {

    word-spacing: 1px;
}
```
