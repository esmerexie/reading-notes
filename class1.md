# Learning [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1)

When writing in Markdown, it is important to know about the spelling and the spacing in which the code is written in. For example, when writing a header it is important to know that there are multiple levels or sizes.

 # Look how big this is
 
 ``` 
  # level 1 ( being the biggest ) ex.
  # (your text here)
  
 ```
 
 ###### Look how small this is
 
 ```
  ###### level 6 ( being the smallest ) ex.
  ###### (your text here)
 ```
 
 ## Or when writing your lines of code, to make sure to add a line of blank space before and after writing a line of code for best practices. 
 
 ```
 # here is my header
 
 see how I added a line of space after my line of code?
 
 I did it again!
 
 ```
 
 as compared to 
 
 ```
 # here is my header
 I am too lazy to add space after that line!
 I did it again!
 
 ```
