# Readings
> For this assignment we were given the task to read certain chapters in the book `HTML & CSS by JON DUCKETT`.

## Chapter 1 Structure
In this chapter we were introduced to the basics of HTML which is the structure of a website. In this structure I was then introduced to `elements`. An example of an element is

```html
<html> </html>
<body> </body>
<h1> </h1>
<p> </p>
```

Elements also consit of two tags. The opening and the closing

```html
<> 
</>
```

To wrap up chapter 1, I then read about attributes and how they can be added to tags or elements by giving it a name and value to provide further information or context. An example of this would be

```html

<p lang="en-us"> Paragraph in english </p>

```

The name of this attribute is `lang` and the vaule given is `"en-us"`.

## Chapter 8 Extra Markups

This chapter was pretty simple. I learned about how `Doctypes` tell browers which version of HTML you are using. Also how we can add comments to our HTML code that would not be visible to the actual website but would be visible in the actual code. 

```html
<!-- Your comment goes here -->
```

I learned that you can group elements by `id` and `class`.

But one of the most interesting thing that stuck out to me the most was the

```html
<iframes> </iframes>
```

tag allows the developer to add a frame in the webpage that can allow for picture, videos, maps, etc.

I also learned special escape characters that can be used to be added to the webpage. Some examples of that would be

```html 
< with &lt;
> with &gt;
" with &quot;
' with &#39;
& with &amp;
```

## Chapter 17 HTML 5 Layout

In this chapter the author talked about the new HTML5 elements and how they are used better than the traditional layout for better a clearer code. And how older browsers can't support HTML5 and in order to make them work extra JS code is needed.

## Chapter 18 Proccess and Design

In summary this chapter talked about knowing your audience. Meaning know what you are trying to advitise. What are you trying to promote and why would users come to your site. If your site provides useful information on said promoted topic and if they are likely to come back and re-visit your site.
Another important thing to note is `Wireframe`. Wireframe is when you layout the design of your site before actually coding and designing. How you want your site to look or how the site should be seen visually by the customer or audience. And how important it is to properly group things to make things in your webpage easily navigable.

## Things I want to know more about

From these chapters alone I want to learn more about writing cleaner and more effective code. How to properly design and group stuff in your code so that the viewing experience is much more pleasable. And how to use much more complex codes such as JS to make your site much more interactive.
